# 🧠 Myke's AI & Healthtech Portfolio

Columbia-trained physician-scientist turned builder.

This space showcases my pivot into AI, healthtech, and systems strategy. I'm blending clinical expertise with real technical execution—from NLP for neuro consults to real-time triage intelligence, autonomous agents, and recovery forecasting.

## 🔧 Projects

## Verdict AI
**Human vs. AI Sentence Classifier**

**Tech Stack:** Python · Scikit-learn · Random Forest · NLP Feature Engineering · Entropy Analysis · CSV Parsing · Jupyter/Colab Compatible

**Description:** Verdict AI classifies sentences as either human-written or AI-generated using handcrafted NLP features (lexical diversity, readability, entropy, sentence variance) and a Random Forest model. Designed as a lightweight forensic tool for editorial screening, student work, or content authenticity detection.

**Outcome:** Trained on labeled dataset with 85%+ accuracy with outputs binary classification with explainable features. Open-sourced and ready for experimentation, tuning, or pipeline integration

### Pathway AI
**Autonomous Customer Support Agent for Airlines**

**Tech Stack:** HTML5 · JavaScript · Gemini API (v1.5 / Flash) · Python Tools · Mock Flight/User DB · LLM Tool Chaining · Secure Prompt Architecture

**Description:** Pathway AI is a real-time, LLM-powered customer service agent that autonomously resolves flight support requests—without ever escalating to a human. From verifying bookings and checking flight delays to rebooking passengers and issuing credits, Pathway handles complex multi-step interactions with speed, accuracy, and empathy.

Built as a technical demo for JetBlue/Southwest-style support workflows, the agent uses scripted tools, dynamic prompt logic, and branded UI/UX to simulate a high-fidelity virtual assistant experience.

**Outcome:** Fully functional demo deployed in browser with integrated mock backend. Resolves issues like delays, rebooking, and refund policies using realistic tool functions. Designed for future Gemini API integration, Claude compatibility, and enterprise LLM chaining. Sets the foundation for an intelligent, white-labeled Tier 1/Tier 2 support replacement.

### Triage AI
**Real-Time Medical Triage Engine with Gemini 2.0**

**Tech Stack:** Python · Gemini 2.0 Flash API · JSON-based Clinical Reasoning · Risk Stratification · Batch Processing · RESTful Architecture

**Description:** Triage AI is a lightning-fast clinical risk stratification engine that analyzes free-text clinical inputs—ED presentations, consult notes, EMS handoffs—and returns structured triage decisions in under 2 seconds. Built on Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, it categorizes patients into EMERGENT/URGENT/SEMI_URGENT/ROUTINE levels with confidence scoring, red flag identification, and next-step clinical actions.

**Outcome:** Achieves 85%+ confidence on standard ED presentations. Processes complex clinical narratives in 1-2 seconds. Built for real-world deployment with color-coded urgency display, audit trails, and HIPAA-compliant architecture.

### Synapse v2.0
**Real-Time NLP Risk Flagging Engine for Neurosurgical Consults**

**Tech Stack:** Python · RegEx · NLP · Clinical Pattern Recognition · Contextual Negation · GPT Integration · OOP

**Description:** Synapse v2.0 is a real-time, neurosurgery-specific natural language processing engine designed to extract critical neurological findings from unstructured consult notes. Built for clinical decision support in high-acuity settings, it flags subtle red flags—motor weakness, sensory deficits, pathological reflexes, AMS, cauda equina signs—with structured severity grading and confidence scoring.

**Outcome:** Validated on real neurosurgical consults with high sensitivity, low false positives. Replicates manual triage logic in less than 10ms per note.

### NEURA
**Recovery Forecasting AI for Post-Treatment Clinical Care**

**Tech Stack:** Google Colab · GPT Integration · Prompt Chaining · Python · Clinical Risk Modeling

**Description:** NEURA predicts and supports patient recovery after surgery, hospitalization, or serious illness. From a single clinical note, it generates a structured recovery risk score (Cognitive, Emotional, Functional, Adherence, Social) and delivers emotionally intelligent journaling prompts and recovery guidance for patients.

**Outcome:** Working prototype demo live in Colab. Open-sourced for pilots, partnerships, and feedback.

## 🎯 The Clinical AI Stack

These projects form a full-stack care and intelligence pipeline:

SYSTEM	FUNCTION
1. Verdict AI	Authenticates authorship – Is this human or AI?
   
2. Triage AI	Front door triage – Who needs help now?
   
3. Synapse	Neuro consult parsing – What exactly is wrong?
   
4. NEURA	Post-discharge forecast – How will recovery unfold?
   
5. Pathway AI	Service automation – How do we serve them better?

Together, they represent a vision for AI across the entire care journey—and beyond.

## 💬 Why This

Because AI should augment, not replace.
Because clinical care and customer experience deserve smarter, faster, more humane tools.

I’m building what I wish I had when I was on call:

- NLP that catches hidden red flags

- Triage engines that don’t miss subtle severity

- Support agents that never burn out

- Recovery tools that meet patients where they are

- Classifiers that defend truth in the AI age

---

## 🚀 What's Next

- 🌐 LLM Expansion: Gemini + Claude integrations across stack

- 🏥 Pilot Testing: Triage AI in telehealth, Verdict AI in education/academia

- 🧠 Research: Submitting abstracts on NLP validation and triage impact

- 🧰 Productization: Building a secure, multi-agent backend with RAG + audit trails
