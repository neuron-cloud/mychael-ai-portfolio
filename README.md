# 🧠 Myke’s AI & Healthtech Portfolio

Columbia-trained physician-scientist turned builder.

This space showcases my pivot into AI, healthtech, and systems strategy. I’m blending clinical expertise with real technical execution—from NLP for neuro consults to intelligent recovery forecasting.

## 🔧 Projects

### Synapse  
**Real-Time Clinical NLP Engine for Neurosurgical Consults**  
**Tech Stack:** Python · RegEx · NLP · Contextual Negation · Pattern Matching

**Description:**  
Synapse is an advanced natural language processing engine purpose-built for parsing real-world neurosurgical consults. It uses flexible regex patterns, structured medical dictionaries, and contextual negation logic to flag subtle neurological risks from free-text physical exams. It can detect focal weakness patterns across multiple muscle groups, differentiate between baseline vs. acute deficits, and extract critical findings like altered mental status, reflex abnormalities, or red flags for cauda equina syndrome.  

**Outcome:**  
Tested on 9 real consults with near-perfect output. Demonstrated capability to replace manual parsing in neurosurgical triage. Future work includes structured JSON export, UI integration, and cross-specialty adaptation.

### NEURA  
**Recovery Forecasting AI for Post-Treatment Clinical Care**  
**Tech Stack:** Google Colab · GPT-4o-mini · Prompt Chaining · Python · Clinical Risk Modeling

**Description:**  
NEURA predicts and supports patient recovery after surgery, hospitalization, or serious illness. From a single clinical note, it generates a structured recovery risk score (Cognitive, Emotional, Functional, Adherence, Social) and delivers emotionally intelligent journaling prompts and recovery guidance for patients. NEURA bridges the blind spot between “discharged” and “actually healing.”  

**Outcome:**  
Working prototype demo live in Colab. Open-sourced for pilots, partnerships, and feedback. Outputs explainable domain-level forecasts + Recovery OS patient support. Future plans include web deployment, structured PDF exports, and pilot testing with high-acuity clinical teams.

## 🧪 Skills in Progress

- Python (prompt chaining, file I/O, NLP structuring)
- Clinical logic modeling + emotional recovery stratification
- Google Colab + GitHub Codespaces
- Streamlit, API wrappers, and full-stack healthtech apps

## 💬 Why This

Because clinical judgment deserves a second brain—and AI shouldn't stop at diagnosis.

I’m building tools I wish I had when the system went silent after discharge. Tools that think like a clinician *and* care like a human.
