# ðŸ§  Myke's AI & Healthtech Portfolio

Columbia-trained physician-scientist turned builder.

This space showcases my pivot into AI, healthtech, and systems strategy. I'm blending clinical expertise with real technical executionâ€”from NLP for neuro consults to real-time triage intelligence, autonomous agents, and recovery forecasting.

## ðŸ”§ Projects

### Pathway AI
**Autonomous Customer Support Agent for Airlines**

**Tech Stack:** HTML5 Â· JavaScript Â· Gemini API (v1.5 / Flash) Â· Python Tools Â· Mock Flight/User DB Â· LLM Tool Chaining Â· Secure Prompt Architecture

**Description:** Pathway AI is a real-time, LLM-powered customer service agent that autonomously resolves flight support requestsâ€”without ever escalating to a human. From verifying bookings and checking flight delays to rebooking passengers and issuing credits, Pathway handles complex multi-step interactions with speed, accuracy, and empathy.

Built as a technical demo for JetBlue/Southwest-style support workflows, the agent uses scripted tools, dynamic prompt logic, and branded UI/UX to simulate a high-fidelity virtual assistant experience.

**Outcome:** Fully functional demo deployed in browser with integrated mock backend. Resolves issues like delays, rebooking, and refund policies using realistic tool functions. Designed for future Gemini API integration, Claude compatibility, and enterprise LLM chaining. Sets the foundation for an intelligent, white-labeled Tier 1/Tier 2 support replacement.

### Triage AI
**Real-Time Medical Triage Engine with Gemini 2.0**

**Tech Stack:** Python Â· Gemini 2.0 Flash API Â· JSON-based Clinical Reasoning Â· Risk Stratification Â· Batch Processing Â· RESTful Architecture

**Description:** Triage AI is a lightning-fast clinical risk stratification engine that analyzes free-text clinical inputsâ€”ED presentations, consult notes, EMS handoffsâ€”and returns structured triage decisions in under 2 seconds. Built on Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, it categorizes patients into EMERGENT/URGENT/SEMI_URGENT/ROUTINE levels with confidence scoring, red flag identification, and next-step clinical actions.

**Outcome:** Achieves 85%+ confidence on standard ED presentations. Processes complex clinical narratives in 1-2 seconds. Built for real-world deployment with color-coded urgency display, audit trails, and HIPAA-compliant architecture.

### Synapse v2.0
**Real-Time NLP Risk Flagging Engine for Neurosurgical Consults**

**Tech Stack:** Python Â· RegEx Â· NLP Â· Clinical Pattern Recognition Â· Contextual Negation Â· GPT Integration Â· OOP

**Description:** Synapse v2.0 is a real-time, neurosurgery-specific natural language processing engine designed to extract critical neurological findings from unstructured consult notes. Built for clinical decision support in high-acuity settings, it flags subtle red flagsâ€”motor weakness, sensory deficits, pathological reflexes, AMS, cauda equina signsâ€”with structured severity grading and confidence scoring.

**Outcome:** Validated on real neurosurgical consults with high sensitivity, low false positives. Replicates manual triage logic in less than 10ms per note.

### NEURA
**Recovery Forecasting AI for Post-Treatment Clinical Care**

**Tech Stack:** Google Colab Â· GPT Integration Â· Prompt Chaining Â· Python Â· Clinical Risk Modeling

**Description:** NEURA predicts and supports patient recovery after surgery, hospitalization, or serious illness. From a single clinical note, it generates a structured recovery risk score (Cognitive, Emotional, Functional, Adherence, Social) and delivers emotionally intelligent journaling prompts and recovery guidance for patients.

**Outcome:** Working prototype demo live in Colab. Open-sourced for pilots, partnerships, and feedback.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Clinical AI Stack

My projects form a continuum of care and service intelligence:

1. **Triage AI** â†’ Front door risk stratification (Who needs help NOW?)  
2. **Synapse v2.0** â†’ Specialty-specific pattern recognition (What exactly is wrong?)  
3. **NEURA** â†’ Post-discharge recovery intelligence (How do we get them home safe?)  
4. **Pathway AI** â†’ Non-clinical service automation (How do we serve them better?)

Together, they represent a vision for AI that enhances every touchpointâ€”clinical or operational.

## ðŸ’¬ Why This

Because judgment deserves augmentationâ€”and systems should care like humans.

I'm building tools I wish I had when the pager rang at 3AM. Tools that catch silent signs in a consult note, triage faster than human reflexes, and support patients after discharge. Tools that one day make customer service something you donâ€™t dread.

## ðŸš€ What's Next

- **LLM Integration:** Expanding Gemini + Claude APIs across all projects  
- **Pilot Partnerships:** Triage AI in telemedicine, Pathway AI in airline/banking sectors  
- **Commercialization:** Building a secure, multi-agent backend with RAG + audit logging  
- **Research:** Submitting abstracts and manuscripts on clinical validation and workflow impact
