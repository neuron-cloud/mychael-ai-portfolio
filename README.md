# 🧠 Myke’s AI & Healthtech Portfolio

Columbia-trained physician-scientist turned builder.

This space showcases my pivot into AI, healthtech, and systems strategy. I’m blending clinical expertise with real technical execution—from NLP for neuro consults to cloud-based clinical tools.

## 🔧 Projects

### 🔹 NEURA: Consult Risk Flagging Engine
> Real-time triage insights for neurosurgical consults

- Built in Python using logic rules and keyword parsing
- Deployed in Google Colab with real anonymized blurbs
- Automatically flags risk phrases (e.g. “MLS”, “clonus”, “coagulopathy”)
- Refined logic to exclude false positives and handle clinical nuance
- [View NEURA Repo →](https://github.com/neuron-cloud/neura-prototype)

## 🧪 Skills in Progress

- Python (control flow, functions, file handling)
- Clinical logic modeling + risk stratification
- Google Colab + GitHub Codespaces
- AWS & Streamlit (coming next)

## 💬 Why This

Because clinical judgment deserves a second brain—and AI shouldn't ignore context.

I'm building tools I wish I had when the stakes were real.
