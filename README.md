# 🧠 Myke’s AI & Healthtech Portfolio

Columbia-trained physician-scientist turned builder.

This space showcases my pivot into AI, healthtech, and systems strategy. I’m blending clinical expertise with real technical execution—from NLP for neuro consults to intelligent recovery forecasting.

## 🔧 Projects

### Synapse v2.0
**Real-Time NLP Risk Flagging Engine for Neurosurgical Consults**

**Tech Stack:** Python · RegEx · NLP · Clinical Pattern Recognition · Contextual Negation · GPT Integration · OOP

**Description:**
Synapse v2.0 is a real-time, neurosurgery-specific natural language processing engine designed to extract critical neurological findings from unstructured consult notes. Built for clinical decision support in high-acuity settings, it flags subtle red flags—motor weakness, sensory deficits, pathological reflexes, AMS, cauda equina signs—with structured severity grading and confidence scoring.

It mimics expert-level clinical reasoning, differentiates baseline vs acute deficits, and contextualizes negated findings using a custom-built engine of compiled regex patterns, medical abbreviation expansion, and pattern-aware negation logic.

**Outcome:**
Validated on real neurosurgical consults with high sensitivity, low false positives. Replicates manual triage logic in less than 10ms per note. Deployed in Jupyter/Colab for live testing and physician-facing demonstrations. Designed for future expansion into EMR integration, JSON export, and specialty adaptation

### NEURA  
**Recovery Forecasting AI for Post-Treatment Clinical Care**  

**Tech Stack:** Google Colab · GPT integration · Prompt Chaining · Python · Clinical Risk Modeling

**Description:**  
NEURA predicts and supports patient recovery after surgery, hospitalization, or serious illness. From a single clinical note, it generates a structured recovery risk score (Cognitive, Emotional, Functional, Adherence, Social) and delivers emotionally intelligent journaling prompts and recovery guidance for patients. NEURA bridges the blind spot between “discharged” and “actually healing.”  

**Outcome:**  
Working prototype demo live in Colab. Open-sourced for pilots, partnerships, and feedback. Outputs explainable domain-level forecasts + Recovery OS patient support. Future plans include web deployment, structured PDF exports, and pilot testing with high-acuity clinical teams.

## 💬 Why This

Because clinical judgment deserves a second brain—and AI shouldn't stop at diagnosis.

I’m building tools I wish I had when the system went silent after discharge. Tools that think like a clinician *and* care like a human.
