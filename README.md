# 🧠 Myke’s AI & Healthtech Portfolio

Columbia-trained physician-scientist turned builder.

This space showcases my pivot into AI, healthtech, and systems strategy. I’m blending clinical expertise with real technical execution—from NLP for neuro consults to cloud-based clinical tools.

## 🔧 Projects

Synapse
Real-Time Clinical NLP Engine for Neurosurgical Consults
Tech Stack: Python · RegEx · NLP · Contextual Negation · Pattern Matching · Clinical Terminology

Description:
Synapse is an advanced natural language processing engine purpose-built for parsing real-world neurosurgical consults. It uses flexible regex patterns, structured medical dictionaries, and contextual negation logic to flag subtle neurological risks from free-text physical exams. It can detect focal weakness patterns across multiple muscle groups, differentiate between baseline vs. acute deficits, and extract critical findings like altered mental status, reflex abnormalities, or red flags for cauda equina syndrome. The engine was benchmarked on real EMR consults and outputs human-readable, severity-prioritized flag summaries in seconds.

Outcome:
Tested on 9 real consults with near-perfect output. Demonstrated capability to replace manual parsing in neurosurgical triage. Future work includes structured JSON export, UI integration, and cross-specialty adaptation.

## 💬 Why This

Because clinical judgment deserves a second brain—and AI shouldn't ignore context.

I'm building tools I wish I had when the stakes were real.
